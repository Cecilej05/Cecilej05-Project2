Project 2 - BeReal CLone Pt.1

09/16/2024


For this project, we launched the BeReal app. In the screen recording, the first thing you see is the BeReal app icon. After clicking it, the launch screen appears, displaying the class name, project name, FAU logo, my name, and Z number. We then reach the login screen, where we click "Sign Up" to create a new account. After signing up, we create a post with a caption and share it. We then log out and log back in using a different account. Again, we post a picture with a caption and share it. Finally, we scroll through the feed and are able to view both posts from the different users before logging out again.
